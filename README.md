#ContactBox
<p>This is my first Symfony project created during workshops on 
backend BootCamp (CodersLab).</p>

###Usage of the app
<p>This is a simple contact box - similar to phone book.</p>
<ul>
<li>you can store your contacts in it - people addresses, emails and phone numbers</li>
<li>on the main page you see all of your contacts</li>
<li>clicking on a contact shows all information about the person</li>
<li>there are buttons to delete and modify contacts</li>
</ul>

###Assumptions of the project
<ol>
<li>App has to preserve assumptions of MVC design pattern.</li>
<li>Considering requirements of Symfony whole app needs to be object oriented.</li>
<li>The validation of input data can be ignored.</li>
<li>The frontend uses only basic CSS to make app little more friendly for the user.</li>
</ol>

###Technical informations.
<ol>
<li>App was created using Symfony 2.7 framework.</li>
<li>As IDE PHPStorm was used.</li>
<li>Vagrant was used with Ubuntu instaled on it.</li>
<li>MySQLi databese was used.</li>
